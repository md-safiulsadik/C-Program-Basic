Here are three effective ways to practice C programming as a beginner:

1. **Hands-on Coding Challenges**: Platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces offer C-specific challenges that can help reinforce concepts.
Start with basic problems and gradually move on to more complex ones. This method is great for applying what you've learned and improving problem-solving skills.

2. **Building Small Projects**: Create simple projects like a calculator, a tic-tac-toe game, or a basic file handling system. 
Working on a project helps you understand how different parts of the language work together and gives you a tangible result at the end.

3. **Reading and Modifying Existing Code**: Look at open-source projects or sample codes online.
 Try to understand how they work, and then modify or add features. This can give you insight into how more experienced programmers structure their code and approach problems.

**Best Method**: **Building Small Projects** is often the most effective.
It provides a practical context for applying your knowledge, helps solidify your understanding, and gives you something tangible to show for your efforts.
